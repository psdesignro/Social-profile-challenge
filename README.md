## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox




### What I learned

I am glad that I managed to write all the CSS by myself, without additional research or Chat GPT. I worked without the Figma file and adjusted the content with my own image and links. Maybe I'll get the pro subscription to be able to style the design closer to the original.
